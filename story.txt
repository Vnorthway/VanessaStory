Once upon a time there was a cat named Tom who loved macaroni. He ate macaroni every single day and began to grow fat. His mother was worried about this and hid all of the macaroni in the house. 

However, Tom was a sneaky cat and he observed where his mother hid all the macaroni. Then one day, when his mother was sleeping, Tom snuck into the kitchen where the macaroni was hidden. He proceeded to eat all the macaroni.
