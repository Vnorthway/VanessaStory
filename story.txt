Once upon a time there was a cat named Tom who loved macaroni. He ate macaroni every single day and began to grow fat. His mother was worried about this and hid all of the macaroni in the house. 


However, Tom was a sneaky cat and he observed where his mother hid all the macaroni. Then one day, when his mother was sleeping, Tom snuck into the kitchen where the macaroni was hidden. He proceeded to eat all the macaroni.

One night, Tom grabbed to eat some macaroni, but he cannot eat too much, because he have a big dinner that night. He decided to hide the rest macaroni again. But after he put it back, he found much empty space left. So he just took away some hay from the farm and put it under the macaroni to eliminate the space. What a clever cat!
